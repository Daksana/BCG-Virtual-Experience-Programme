This repository contains the work and findings from my project with BCG's virtual internship program, focusing on addressing the churn problem for PowerCo, a leading gas and electricity utility supplier. 
Through data analysis, I have explored the significant churn rates, particularly within the SME segment, which are largely driven by the liberalization of the energy market in Europe. 
The files herein detail my approach to utilizing predictive models to identify customers at risk of churn and evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed discounting strategy to mitigate this issue. 
The insights derived aim to inform PowerCo's strategic decisions and support discussions with the head of the SME division.
